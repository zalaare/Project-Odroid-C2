# The udev rules are read from the files located in the system rules 
# directory /usr/lib/udev/rules.d, the volatile runtime directory
# /run/udev/rules.d and the local administration directory 
# /etc/udev/rules.d. All rules files are collectively sorted and 
# processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which 
# they live. However, files with identical filenames replace each 
# other. Files in /etc have the highest priority, files in /run take 
# precedence over files with the same name in /usr/lib. This can be 
# used to override a system-supplied rules file with a local file if
# needed; a symlink in /etc with the same name as a rules file in 
# /usr/lib, pointing to /dev/null, disables the rules file entirely. 
# Rule files must have the extension .rules; other extensions are ignored.
